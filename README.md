# AccidentAnalysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn


## Overview
This script analyzes a dataset (df.csv) containing incident data with respect to cause categories and million plus cities. The analysis involves computing summary statistics for each cause category and million plus city, generating visualizations, and identifying top cause categories based on mean and median values. Furthermore, it identifies high-risk cause categories based on a predefined threshold.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset is stored in a CSV file named 'df.csv'. The script assumes that this file exists in the same directory as the Python script.

## Data Processing
1. Reading the CSV file using `pd.read_csv` function from pandas library.
2. Performing groupby operations for cause categories and million plus cities to compute summary statistics.
3. Visualizing trends and patterns using barplots, heatmaps, and piecharts with seaborn and matplotlib functions.

## Analysis Steps
1. Grouping the data by 'Cause category' using `groupby` function from pandas and performing aggregation to calculate count, mean, and median values. This results in `cause_category_summary`.
2. Grouping the data by 'Million Plus Cities' using `groupby` function from pandas and performing aggregation to calculate count, mean, and median values. This results in `city_summary`.
3. Merging the two summaries (`cause_category_summary` and `city_summary`) into a single dataframe named `summary`.
4. Generating a barplot of total incidents by cause category using seaborn's `barplot` function.
5. Computing pivot table for incidents per city and cause category, but this part is commented out for simplicity.
6. Generating a piechart of incidents per cause category using matplotlib's `pie` function.
7. Calculating total incidents by cause category and generating a piechart to display the results.
8. Identifying top 5 cause categories with highest mean and median values.
9. Displaying the top cause categories in console and generating corresponding barplots using seaborn's `barplot` function.
10. Identifying high-risk cause categories based on a predefined threshold of 10% of total incidents.
11. Displaying the high-risk cause categories in console and generating a piechart to show their distribution.

 ## Future Features
The current implementation provides an analysis of incident data based on cause categories and cities. However, there are several potential extensions that could be added for further insights:

1. **Temporal Analysis**: Incorporate time-series analysis to examine trends over different periods, such as months or years, and identify any significant changes in incident patterns.
2. **Demographic Analysis**: Extend the analysis to include demographic factors like age, gender, income level, etc., to gain a better understanding of how various demographics are affected by incidents related to different cause categories.
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Incorporate geospatial data to visualize incident patterns on maps and identify any spatial correlations between cause categories and specific locations.
4. **Predictive Analysis**: Use machine learning models to predict future incidents based on historical data, demographic information, and other relevant factors. This could help in planning preventative measures and mitigating potential risks.
5. **Interactive Visualizations**: Develop interactive dashboards that allow users to explore incident data from multiple dimensions (e.g., cause categories, time, location, demographics) and facilitate ad-hoc analysis and drill-down functionality.
6. **External Data Integration**: Incorporate external datasets such as weather, traffic, or event data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how various factors impact incident patterns. This could provide valuable insights for public safety agencies and policymakers.
